Hardware DLL needs superuser permissions to access the PR_FILE, CFG_FILE, and MEM_FILE files.

Addresses are represented in hexadecimal bytes. Example: 64KB = 65536B = 0x10000.
All hardware accelerator interrupts and the data signal of ap_return are ignored.

The maximum number of I/O parameters per hardware accelerator is determined by the address range of each reconfigurable partition (RP_RANGE); therefore it is a hard limit (set by hardware).
The maximum number of hardware accelerators (HWA_MAX) is a soft limit (set by software).

The first local maximum number of reconfigurable partitions (CHAR_BIT * sizeof (int)) is a hard limit.
The second local maximum number of reconfigurable partitions (RP_MAX) is a soft limit.
The absolute maximum number of reconfigurable partitions is the minimum of the two local maxima.

The maximum size of a partial bin file on a 32-bit system is 2GB.
This hard limit is not enforced by Hardware DLL. Users should verify the sizes of their partial bin files.

Hardware DLL was tested within these limits.
If the soft limits are modified, Hardware DLL may still function correctly, but some information will not be properly displayed.
The hard limits should not be modified!



Software Notes:

The "timespec" data structures are synchronized each time their "tv_nsec" member wraps (rolls over from its maximum count back to zero during the measurement interval).
However, there is no need to check if the "tv_sec" member wraps, because its count cycle is more than 68 years long.

The condition "sort_hwa_list[j]->rm_avl_size < sort_hwa_list[length]->rm_avl_size" is used in interface function "hwdll_load_list" to sort the list of hardware accelerator pointers.
If the two numbers of available reconfigurable modules are equal to each other, the hardware accelerator pointers are ordered arbitrary.
